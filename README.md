# Good-Pomodoro

  So basically I got tired of trying all the pomodoro clis out
  there that seem to take a lot of assumptions of how the user
  wants to receive notifications and that also seem to provide
  a crufty interface to actually use the pomodoro technique,
  so here it is, another one, I should be workig right now...

### ADVICE!!
  This application is in a very early stage, it might break
  but shouldnt do anything terrible unless you tell it to
